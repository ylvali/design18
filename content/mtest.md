### Ett test av markdown

A paragraph is so easy to make, just make a space. A space is something like a pause,
in markdown no html tags are necessary, the letter p will not surround what you write anymore.

There are different types of headers too:
A line of '=' makes a h1
=======================
1 underline makes a h2
-----------------------
### Then 3 hashes make the h3
#### 4 hashes the h4
... and so on.

> The blockquote can be made with brackets '<'

To give emphasis, just use the *star* on both sides of the word.
Or use the _underscore_ to do so.

Double for **stronger**
Yes, double for __stronger__

Make a list by
----------------------------------
*   The star.
*   The subtractions sign.
*   The addition sign.


Or a numbered list by
-----------------------------------
1.  nr1
2.  nr2
3.  nr3

and so on...

Links are made with brackets and parenthesis [Bth page](http://www.bth.se "BTH")
There is also a reference link system.

Images ![img](img/space.jpg "Space") are printed similarly to the links.

 Code can be printed within such markup , such as ampersands and angle brackets.
 --> &dash '<blink' <--
